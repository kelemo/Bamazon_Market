# Node.js & MySQL

In this activity, we are going  to create an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL and node.js skills. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

Make sure you save and require the MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in your homework files--your app will need them for data input and storage.
